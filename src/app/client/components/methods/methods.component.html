            <h2>Body Shape</h2>
            <p>
              Body shapes differ in body fat levels and muscle accumulation and
              are determined by genetics. People have different body shapes,
              with men having rectangular shape and women having hourglass
              shape.

            <p>
              HIIT, or high-intensity interval training, is a training technique
              in which you give all-out, one hundred percent effort through
              quick, intense bursts of exercise, followed by short, sometimes
              active, recovery periods.
